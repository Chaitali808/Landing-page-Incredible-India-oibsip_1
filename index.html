            <p>One of the oldest civilisations in the world, India is a mosaic of multicultural experiences.
                <br> With a rich heritage and myriad attractions, the country is among the most popular tourist <br>
                destinations in the world. It covers an area of 32, 87,263 sq. km, extending from the <br>snow-covered 
                Himalayan heights to the tropical rain forests of the south. As the 7th largest<br> country in the
                 world, India stands apart from the rest of Asia, marked off as it is by mountains<br> and the sea,
                 which give the country a distinct geographical entity.
