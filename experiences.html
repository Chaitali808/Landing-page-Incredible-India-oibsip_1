            <h2>Kedarnath trip...</h2>
        </span>
        <br>      
            The horse ride through the narrow cobbled lane, lush green meadows all around with waterfalls and river bridges, people chanting “Jai Kedar!!” makes the journey absolutely blissful.
            We did the Kedarnath Yatra in September end. I had lot of queries before arranging this trip but could not get much information on Internet about the current situation in Uttarakhand after the 2013 disaster. Hence I am writing this review.
            We took a road trip from Dehradun to Guptkashi. Which was around 200 KM drive but it took us 8 log hours to complete this journey because of a narrow roads passing through hills and a deep valley on the other side. Within a one year of the disaster,i will say that the authorities have done a great job of repairing and reconstructing the roads and bridges. At several points we could see the old section of road which is completely washed away and there was a new road constructed. Many of the bridges were destroyed and now they have constructed the new wider bridges by passing the old ones. 2014 rains have again destroyed the roads at several places but the repairing work is in progress.
            We stayed for a night at Guptkashi. Fortunately the weather was pretty clear. Himalayan Heli services is running Helicopter rides for Kedarnath Darshan from Sersi. This was approximately 20KM distance from our hotel which took us 1 hour. Himalayan Helicopter service was delayed for an hour because of weather problem but once they got a clearance our flight was scheduled immediately and we reached Kedarnath within a few minutes. It was a simply divine experience to finally reach at Kedarnath. This place is so beautiful!! Since there are not many pilgrims going on Char Dham yatra now, we had a very peaceful darshan and did pooja of Shri Kedarnath. We returned back by the same helicopter after one and a half hour.
            Here also authorities have done a great work of restoration. The place is in much much better state now than it was after the disaster. We are really happy that we took a chance and completed this yatra successfully and without any difficulty.

           <h2>Visit of Statue of Unity...</h2>
           <br>
        </span>
         
            Out of the world tourist attraction, and gives a very proud feeling of having such a place to visit in India Engineering marvel aside of the actual statue, the entire area has been done up extremely well, with plenty of options for visitors to spend a day or 2
            Having travelled to many tourist destinations abroad, I would strongly advise international places to come visit the SoU, and learn how to provide excellent facilities to all he women empowered e autos were a nice touch, and very progressive in thought and action
            Can go on and on, but without simply recommended all to visit this

          <h2>Taj Mahal...</h2>
          <br>
       </span>
       
       I think more than enough has been written on how beautiful the Taj is. There is nothing more that I can say.... so I won't add to that. Instead, here are a few quick thoughts to help your visit:
        1. Come either early or late in the day - there are less people early morning but the weather in evening can't be beat - of course this depends on the time of year you visit. We were there this time in early March at around 4pm; had great lighting for pictures and very comfortable weather.
        2. Get a guide - you may or may not care to hear all the details that a good guide would have to offer on the Taj but they come in handy for moving you through the crowds and for a taking a picture of your group.
        3. Spend the money on one of the "professional photographers" - for about $50 (after a little negotiating) we got roughly 30 or so 5x7 prints in an album plus a digital copy of all the pictures. The photographers are very help in moving people out of the way at the prime spots for taking a picture. You pay after you've seen the pictures and most were quite good.
        This was my third and best visit to the Taj mostly b/c of the great weather. I've come before in February and it was a bit cold and foggy to see it well. I've also visited in the summer months which was miserably hot - no surprise there.
